### Bugs Reports and Support Issues

If you are submitting a bug report or asking about a problem, please include the following information with your submission:

1. wolfSSL version number
2. Operating System version
3. Compiler version
4. The exact error you are seeing
5. A description of how we can reproduce or try to replicate this problem

With the above information, we will do our best to resolve your problems. Without this information, it is very hard to pinpoint the source of the problem. wolfSSL values your feedback and makes it a top priority to get back to you as soon as possible.

## Consulting

wolfSSL offers both on and off site consulting - providing feature additions, porting, a Competitive Upgrade Program (see [Competitive Upgrade Program](#competitive-upgrade-program)), and design consulting.

### Feature Additions and Porting

We can add additional features that you may need which are not currently offered in our products on a contract or co-development basis. We also offer porting services on our products to new host languages or new operating environments.

### Competitive Upgrade Program

We will help you move from an outdated or expensive SSL/TLS library to wolfSSL with low cost and minimal disturbance to your code base.

Program Outline:

1. You need to currently be using a commercial competitor to wolfSSL.
2. You will receive up to one week of on-site consulting to switch out your old SSL library for wolfSSL. Travel expenses are not included.
3. Normally, up to one week is the right amount of time for us to make the replacement in your code and do initial testing. Additional consulting on a replacement is available as needed.
4. You will receive the standard wolfSSL royalty free license to ship with your product.
5. The price is $10,000.

The purpose of this program is to enable users who are currently spending too much on their embedded SSL implementation to move to wolfSSL with ease. If you are interested in learning more, then please contact us at [info@wolfssl.com](mailto:info@wolfssl.com).

### Design Consulting

If your application or framework needs to be secured with SSL/TLS but you are uncertain about how the optimal design of a secured system would be structured, we can help!

We offer design consulting for building SSL/TLS security into devices using wolfSSL. Our consultants can provide you with the following services:

1. _Assessment_:  An evaluation of your current SSL/TLS implementation. We can give you advice on your current setup and how we think you could improve upon this by using wolfSSL.
2. _Design_:  Looking at your system requirements and parameters, we'll work closely with you to make recommendations on how to implement wolfSSL into your application such that it provides you with optimal security.

If you would like to learn more about design consulting for building SSL into your application or device, please contact [info@wolfssl.com](mailto:info@wolfssl.com) for more information.
